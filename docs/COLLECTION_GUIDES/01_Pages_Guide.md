# Pages Collection Guide

## What is the Pages Collection?

The **Pages** collection manages all the pages on your website. Each page can contain multiple content blocks that you arrange to create the page layout.

## Common Tasks

### Editing the Homepage

1. Go to **Pages** in the left sidebar
2. Find the page with slug "home" (usually titled "Home")
3. Click on it to open
4. Edit the page title, slug, or SEO settings
5. To edit page content, see the **Blocks** section below
6. Click **Save** when done

### Creating a New Page

1. Go to **Pages**
2. Click **Create Item** (or the "+" button)
3. Fill in:
   - **Page Title** - The name of your page
   - **URL Slug** - The URL part (e.g., "about-us" creates /about-us)
   - **Status** - Start with "Draft"
4. Click **Save**
5. Add blocks to build the page content (see Page Builder section)

### Managing Page Status

- **Draft** - Page is not visible on website, safe to edit
- **Published** - Page is live and visible to visitors
- **Archived** - Page is hidden but kept for reference

**Tip:** Always create pages as Draft first, then publish when ready.

## Field-by-Field Guide

- **Format:** Lowercase, use hyphens, no spaces

## Page Builder (Blocks)

Pages are built using content blocks. Here's how to manage them:

1. In the **Blocks** section, click **Create Item** or "+"
2. Select the block type (Hero, Services, Team, etc.)
3. Fill in the block content
4. Set the **Sort** order (1 = first, 2 = second, etc.)
5. Click **Save**

### Editing a Block

1. Find the block in the **Blocks** section
2. Click on the block to edit it
3. Make your changes
4. Click **Save**

### Reordering Blocks

1. Edit each block
2. Change the **Sort** number:
   - Block with sort = 1 appears first
   - Block with sort = 2 appears second
   - And so on...
3. Click **Save** on each block

### Removing a Block

1. Edit the block
2. Delete it (or change page association)
3. The block will no longer appear on the page

## Best Practices

1. **Use descriptive titles** - Make it clear what the page is about
2. **Keep slugs short** - Shorter URLs are better
3. **Fill SEO fields** - Help search engines find your pages
4. **Start with Draft** - Edit safely before publishing
5. **Organize blocks logically** - Think about the flow of information
6. **Test before publishing** - Review as Draft first
